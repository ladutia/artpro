            .tooltip-user__work Co-Founder &amp; CEO
            .tooltip-user__desc With an extensive sales background spanning property, collectible investments and fine art, Oliver has been a driving force in the success of the companies he has worked with. His passion for knowledge and tireless work ethic has earned him a credible reputation amongst his peers and loyal clients, entrusted with the management of million-pound portfolios and consistently exceeding monthly targets of £100k new business. <br/>Oliver’s recreational love of the contemporary art world enticed him into the international art market. He has since established strong bonds with the artists, agents and galleries he works amongst and is trusted implicitly by his buyers. Oliver has sought to further his knowledge and feed his hunger for information through extracurricular learning at the Sotheby’s Institute of Art, London. <br/>His diverse sales history is further reinforced by a keen interest in economics, politics and property. Oliver’s past experience makes him a well-rounded leader and conscientious team builder, capitalising on the best strengths of each member.

            .tooltip-user__name Ashleigh Ulysses
            .tooltip-user__work Co-Founder &amp; COO
            .tooltip-user__desc Ashleigh’s passion for business operations and development lies in her desire to understand the motivations of everything, from the company ethos to the psychology of the target audience. Working with long established companies and aiding start-ups proved that many companies have the resources at hand but lacked the knowledge and direction to implement measurable changes. Ashleigh believes in an ‘inside-out’, organic approach to development. Her most proud business achievement lay in reforming a family-oriented building contractor with cash flow issues and dwindling contracts. Identifying their core strengths as well as issues requiring immediate attention allowed her to implement changes that re-launched it as a market leader. Winning national contracts for retailers such as Boots PLC and Superdrug and growing the team and turnover in the process.<br/>Being a late adopter of ‘crypto-fever’ has not hampered Ashleigh’s development in the field; her traditional approach to business paired with her fascination for blockchain-based solutions in the modern world is helping to shape the future of ArtPro.

            .tooltip-user__desc Jerry Chai is a graduate of the University of California, San Diego and senior full stack software engineer with extensive background in JavaScript and Solidity development. He is experienced in managing and implementing a variety of Ethereum-based blockchain projects, ranging from Initial Coin Offerings to Distributed Application (dApp) development, most notably having been part of the development of the CoinFi ICO and 6fusion which utilised the Quorum Blockchain to host a cloud management platform with the ability to distribute workloads by turning clouds into pay-as-you-go billable utilities. Jerry was headhunted early in the ArtPro journey as our back-end developer and has created our tokens and smart contracts. An integral part of the team, Jerry took a leap of faith in working with the founders when the platform was little more than a great concept and continues to prove himself an asset.
